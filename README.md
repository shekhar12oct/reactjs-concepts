# 🚀 ReactJSConcepts

A comprehensive guide and interactive code examples covering **core ReactJS concepts** — built to help you **learn, revise, and master** modern React fundamentals with clear explanations and real-world use cases.

## 📚 What’s Inside?

This project includes modular examples and documentation for each of the following React concepts:

### 🔤 JSX (JavaScript XML)
- Syntax extension that looks like HTML but runs in JavaScript.
- Makes component structure clear and expressive.

### 🧱 Components
- Functional and Class-based (legacy).
- Focus on reusable, composable UI pieces.

### 📦 Props
- Immutable data passed from parent to child.
- Enables dynamic component rendering.

### 🔄 State
- Internal component data that can change over time.
- Managed using `useState`.

### 🧩 Hooks
Modern React’s way of handling state, effects, refs, etc. Includes:
- `useState`
- `useEffect`
- `useMemo`
- `useCallback`
- `useRef`
- `useReducer`
- `useContext`

### 🌱 Lifecycle / Effects
- `useEffect` for side effects (fetching data, DOM updates).
- Clean-up logic for component unmounting.

### 🔁 Conditional Rendering
- Render different content based on conditions using ternary, logical AND, or conditional functions.

### 📃 Lists and Keys
- Render arrays of elements efficiently using `.map()` and unique `key` props.

### ⬆️ Lifting State Up
- Centralize shared state in the nearest common ancestor component.

### 🌐 Context API
- Avoid prop drilling by providing global data across deeply nested components.

### 🪝 Refs
- Access and manipulate DOM elements or persist values across renders.

### ⚡ Memoization (Performance)
- `React.memo` – memoize components to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- `useMemo` – memoize computed values.
- `useCallback` – memoize functions for child component stability.

### 🧭 React Router (optional module)
- Navigate between views without page reloads.
- Includes dynamic routing and nested routes.

### 📋 Forms & Controlled Inputs
- Bind input elements to component state for real-time control and validation.
